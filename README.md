## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
### What I learned

After this project, I will do every next project with Mobile-first workflow: Taking a Mobile First approach aims to reverse the workflow of designing for desktop and scaling down the design for mobile afterwards.

Looking for an idea how to make a menu for mobile devices, I read for the first time about CSS property: opacity. I decided to use this property. It is used in a condition in the JavaScript file. 

Like every project, I used the html validator to validate the document.
